### NullSecurityX Subdomain Scanner

NullSecurityX Subdomain Scanner is a DNS-based subdomain discovery tool. This tool scans potential subdomains for a specified domain using brute-force methods and quickly generates results through parallel queries via the Cloudflare DNS API.

#### Key Features:
- **Brute-Force Generation**: Produces all possible combinations within the specified character set (charset) and minimum/maximum length range (e.g., 1-2 character subdomains using a-z and 0-9 characters).
- **Parallel DNS Queries**: Uses cURL multi-handle to perform queries in batches of 30, increasing scan speed.
- **Real-Time Visual Interface**: Provides dynamic updates during scanning via JavaScript; attempted subdomains are highlighted in blue, and found ones in green. Results are saved to a text file (results.txt).
- **Security and Limitations**: You can limit the number of scans with the limit parameter, or run in unlimited mode (0). Memory and time limits are optimized in PHP.
- **User Interface**: Features a modern gradient background, integrated rounded logo (from NullSecurityX's X profile), hover effects, and a mobile-responsive design for visual appeal.

#### Usage:
1. Enter the domain (e.g., example.com).
2. Customize the charset (default: a-z0-9).
3. Set min/max length and limit.
4. Click "Start Scan".

This tool is ideal for security testing (pentest) or domain discovery, but ensure legal and ethical useâ€”only run it on your own domains or with permission. Scan results are displayed live in the browser and logged to a file.
